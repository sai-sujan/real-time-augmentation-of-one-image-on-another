# real-time-augmentation-of-one-image-on-another

USAGE------------------------
create 2 folders 
    1)Imagesquery
    2)Testvideos1
In Imagesquery upload the images which is physically avaliable to you.
In Testvideos1 upload the same number of videos that imagequery have.
Then run the program.
If you show the 1st image which is present in the Imagesquery folder to your webcam then it will augment the 1st video in the testvideos1 folder on the physical image you have.
 if you upload the images in testvideos1 folder it will augment images as well but need to change the code that take images format instead of video format
